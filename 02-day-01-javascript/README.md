This assignment demonstrates several key JavaScript concepts through four problems:

### Problems Implemented

1. **`secondLargest(array)`**
   - Finds the second largest number without using `.sort()`.
   - Manages edge cases and input validation.

2. **`calculateFrequency(string)`**
   - Counts character frequency using arrays (no built-in methods).
   - Focuses on lowercase ASCII letters only.

3. **`flatten(unflatObject)`**
   - Flattens nested JavaScript objects or arrays into dot-notated keys.

4. **`unflatten(flatObject)`**
   - Reconstructs nested structure from a flattened dot-notated object.

### Concepts Practiced

- Array manipulation and conditionals  
- Manual frequency calculation using ASCII  
- Recursive object traversal  
- Type checking and nesting logic
